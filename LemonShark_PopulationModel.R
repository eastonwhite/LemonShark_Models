#This script runs a population model for lemon sharks in a nursery lagoon in Bimini, Bahamas. 
#This model is desribed in White et al 2014 "Modeling lemon shark population dynamics"
#Currently the script using a Poisson process to calculate litter sizes but this can be modified to use a litter size distribution from a genetic study (see below and paper)

#this code has not been optimized for speed
