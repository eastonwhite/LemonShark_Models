LemonShark_Models
=================

Models used on Lemon shark population modeling project ([White et al 2014](http://www.biologydirect.com/content/9/1/23) in Biology Direct). Additional data and R code was used in the manuscript that is not posted here. Please contact Easton White (eawhite@ucdavis.edu) for more information. 


The script LemonShark_PopulationModel.R runs a age-structured stochastic model of lemon sharks in Bimini, Bahamas. The model is desribed in:
[White ER, Nagy JD, Gruber SH. (2014) Modeling the population dynamics of lemon sharks. Biology Direct. 9(1): 23](http://www.biologydirect.com/content/9/1/23)

Other models may be added to this repository in the future.
